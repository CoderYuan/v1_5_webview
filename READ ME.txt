The purpose of this interface is to allow customers to use HTML and Javascript on a webpage to call our messaging SDK in 
Android Native code.

You will still need the following.
-LivePerson Asyncronous Android SDK
-WebappInterface.java file
-access to any activity in order to pass it to the WebappInterface

Why would you use this?
-You use a hybrid app and mostly don't have access to the native code.
-You want to be able to update look and feel of messaging buttons without having to do an app release
